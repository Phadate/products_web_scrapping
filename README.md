# Web Scraping Used Mercedes-Benz Cars: A Comprehensive Data Extraction Pipeline

**Summary:**

This project demonstrates a robust web scraping technique to extract detailed information about used Mercedes-Benz cars from Cars.com. By leveraging Python libraries like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`, we efficiently parse HTML content and extract key data points including:

* Car Name
* Price
* Mileage
* Dealer Name
* Review Rating
* Review Count

The script iterates through multiple pages of search results, ensuring a comprehensive data collection process. The extracted data is organized into a structured DataFrame and exported to an Excel file for further analysis and visualization. 

**Key Features and Techniques:**

* **Efficient Web Scraping:** Employs `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to effectively fetch and parse HTML content.
* **Data Extraction:** Precisely targets specific HTML elements to extract relevant information.
* **Error Handling:** Incorporates `try-except` blocks to handle potential exceptions and ensure script robustness.
* **Data Cleaning and Formatting:** Cleans the extracted data and formats it appropriately for analysis.
* **Data Organization:** Structures the data into a Pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation and analysis.
* **Data Export:** Exports the final DataFrame to an Excel file for further exploration.

This project serves as a practical example of web scraping, providing valuable insights into the automotive market and demonstrating the power of Python for data extraction and analysis.
